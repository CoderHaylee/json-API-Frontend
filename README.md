A Very Simple CGI Script ment to take a Json output, such as from Digital Ocean's App Feature, and turn it into a text output more friendly to an end user.
Script is easy to modify if needed. For anyone unaware, just 'print("<HTMLCode>")' will let you change it. Should also work with CSS and Javascripts if added in properly (Though not tested).
